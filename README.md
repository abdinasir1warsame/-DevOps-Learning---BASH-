# 🛡️ DevOps Bash Scripting – Bash Battle Arena

Welcome to my **Bash scripting repository**! This collection captures my journey learning Bash, completing challenges, and building practical automation skills applicable to DevOps workflows. From beginner commands to advanced scripts combining multiple concepts, each level represents a challenge I completed and saved here.

## 📝 Learning & Notes

For foundational learning, I documented essential Bash concepts in [bash_mastery_notes.md](notes/bash_mastery_notes.md). This includes shebangs, variables, loops, functions, conditional statements, arrays, error handling, and more — rewritten in a beginner-friendly style for quick reference.

The `bash_tasks` folder contains **short practice scripts** to reinforce basic concepts before tackling the Battle Arena challenges.

Each script in the Battle Arena is **standalone**, interactive where applicable, and demonstrates a specific challenge I completed, progressing from foundational skills to advanced automation. This repository reflects my learning journey, hands-on problem solving, and creative approach to Bash scripting.
